 * Meaning of an interrogatory. The word ?question? has two common meanings: first, a written or spoken expression of
 * inquiry, and second, the meaning of such an inquiry. By the second definition, a single
 * question could be asked in two languages. But by the first definition, using two language
 * results in two expressions, and therefore, two questions. The concept ?question? is here
 * defined in the second sense (meaning) and should not be confused with the expression or
 * representation of a question.
