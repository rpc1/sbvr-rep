 * Proposition that is taken as true. How one ascertains what is true, whether by assertion, observation, or other means, is outside
 * the scope of this specification. However, taking a proposition as true must be consistent with
 * epistemic commitment. The concept ?fact? is here defined to be consistent with the operations
 * of truth-functional logic, which produce results based on true and false.
